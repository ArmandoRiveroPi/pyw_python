Instructions to use:

Use Python 3.8 if possible, I haven't tested it with other versions

The Pillow library needs a font file to watermark images, so
you'll need to set the FONT_FILE class field as the path to
a suitable font file.

Create a virtual environment, activate it and install the requirements.

attrs==20.3.0
beautifulsoup4==4.9.3
certifi==2020.12.5
chardet==4.0.0
idna==2.10
iniconfig==1.1.1
packaging==20.9
Pillow==8.1.2
pluggy==0.13.1
py==1.10.0
pyparsing==2.4.7
requests==2.25.1
soupsieve==2.2
toml==0.10.2
urllib3==1.26.3

Then run with the environment activated
python pyw_uploader.py

    To be honest, I'm not sure if you should be hiring me.
    
    I mean, I don't have much solid, full-time experience. What I do have, on the other hand,
    it's a lot of love for programming and for code, an almost obsessive desire to create great code
    that can act as the long term foundation for a successful organization. That, and a equal burning passion
    for learning new programming stuff. I like to believe that, since I love learning so much, I'm kind of good at it.
    
    I have my weaknesses for sure. I'm a bit slow, since I prefer to do things carefully. I get bored if I
    have to do the same thing over and over. My spirit falls if I have to multitask for too long. 
    I prefer doing focused, high quality work instead. I'd love to correct the worst weaknesses
    I can see and the others I'm surely missing and would be forever grateful for any guidance in that regard. 
    
    To summarize, if you want somebody that will grow with you, that you can ask to try new ideas and technologies, 
    I could be your guy. If you want a generalist, that knows a bit about many things and will try to learn
    about your organization out of pure curiosity, that could be me. If, instead,
    you want somebody fast from day zero, that you could plug in to perform the same
    kind of work forever, I'd probably not recommend hiring myself.  
    
    Thanks for listening to the rant :)
